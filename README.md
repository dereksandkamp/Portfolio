### Derek Sandkamp
This repository contains the first three projects that I created during the Software Guild Coding Bootcamp at Concordia University. Feel free to open up the solutions and test them out! All three are console applications to demonstrate my grasp of object-oriented programming. At the bootcamp, I am currently working on a full ASP.NET MVC 5 application, in addition to my side project which is also ASP.NET MVC. 

**Tic Tac Toe:** The first graded assignment at the bootcamp was to make a 2-player tic-tac-toe game. I went a step further and made a 1-player mode, then went a step further still and added different difficulty levels, including "unbeatable!" 

**Battleship:** Continuing the game theme, the second graded assignment was to create a console version of the board game Battleship. After I had a working game, I spiced up the UI by adding adding ASCII Art animations when ships are sunk.

**Flooring Program:** This was a partner project that demonstrates the use of n-tier application structure and file IO. A user enters an order for this fictional flooring company to be stored in the program, and displayed or edited later. The program will write the order to either a CSV, XML, or JSON file depending on the filewriteformat specified in app.config. The program can detect and read all of these file types. My partner and I worked closely and split the work evenly in all the tiers, although I handled the XML repository. I also wrote the logic that allows a user to enter commas and quotations into fields that will be written to a CSV file.
